        <span id="starting-style">In</span> this blog, we’re going to build the
        <span class="highlight-text">Video Chat without voice channel</span>
        using OpenCV and Sockets in Python.
      </p>
      <span> Let’s start with a plan: </span>
      <ul class="lists-in-blog">
        <li>Create a TCP socket for one to one communication.</li>
        <li>Take the live stream from the camera.</li>
        <li>Use multi-threading for a duplex channel.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <span class="highlight-text">OpenCV</span> is the library used for image
        and video processing using Python.We can do anything related to images
        and videos using it. We crop, edit,create images and make videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="highlight-text">Socket</span> is the low-level networking
        interface that is used to connect two nodes on a network to communicate
        with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="highlight-text">Threading</span> is the library used to
        create a multi-threaded program in python.
      </p>
      <span>Let’s start implementing the plan:</span>
      <p>
        Firstly we will create the TCP socket using the socket library using the
        following code:
      </p>
      <ul class="lists-in-blog">
        <li>
          Setting the protocol to TCP and address family to IPv4 address family.
          <p class="code-text">
            # tcp and ipv4 address <br />
            familytcp = socket.SOCK_STREAM<br />
            afm = socket.AF_INET<br />
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Creating a socket using the TCP and AFM variables.
          <p class="code-text">
            # creating socket<br />
            sa = socket.socket(afm,tcp) <br />
            sb = socket.socket(afm,tcp)
          </p>
          <p>
            sa and sb are the sockets created to communicate between the two
            nodes. We can use a single socket to achieve the same too.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Binding the IP address with port number.
          <p class="code-text">sa.bind((usera_ip,usera_port))</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Start listening at the socket.
          <p class="code-text">sa.listen()</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Start accepting the connection from the node.
          <p class="code-text">session, addr = sa.accept()</p>
          <p>
            sa.accept() is used to accept the connection request from other
            nodes. session stores the session data and uses it to send and
            receive the request while addr is used to store the address of the
            receiver’s node.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Connect this node to the other node.
          <p class="code-text">sb.connect((usera_ip,2001))</p>
          <p>
            Then, we need to design the sophisticated receive and send for
            receiving and sending the video.
          </p>
          <img

            class="blog-images"
          />
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        receive() function includes the infinite loop of receiving the video
        frame using the following block of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        session.recv(buff_size) is used to receive the byte array from the node.
        Then, np.frombuffer() is used to store the byte back into the numpy
        arraay with np.uint8 data type which stores the value in the range of 0
        to 255. Then, cv2.imdecode(image_arr, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR) is used to
        decode the image back to the colored image with cv2.IMREAD_COLOR
        arguement.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if the image is empty with data type of Nonetype, the program will
        pass or else show the frames continuously using cv2.imshow(image_name,
        image) and cv2.waitKey(10) is used to make the frame wait for 10
        milliseconds and exit if the keyword input is Enter(13) key.
      </p>
      <p>
        cv2.destroyAllWindows() is used to destroy the image window completely
        and exit the thread using os._exit(0).
      </p>
      <p>
        send() function includes the infinite loop of sending the video frame
        using the following block of code.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*VebakYkTxj1MAyrUPWpAMg.png"
        alt=""
        class="blog-images"
      />
      <p>
        cv2.VideoCapture(0) is used to access the camera and the camera can be
        changed using the number passed as an arguement. capture stores the
        camera access methods like read() the input from the camera or release()
        is the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
        capture.read() returns two variable, first as a bool value that either
        the picture is taken or not as true or false and second as the photo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, if the ret is True encode the image using imencode(‘.jpg’,photo)
        and returns two variable and second variable as the encoded array and
        converted to the bytes using .tobytes which can be sent over the socket.
      </p>
      <p>
        sendall(byte_encoded_array) sends all the data over the socket and data
        is sent to the destination node untill all the data is sent successfully
        to the destination node.
      </p>
      <img

        alt=""
        class="blog-images"
      />
      <p>
        We need to create the threads for simultaneously receiving and sending
        the video using thread.Thread(target=func) with the target as send() and
        receive() giving functions to separate threads.
      </p>
      <img

        alt=""
        class="blog-images"
      />
      <p>
        Then, we should run the programs on both the nodes. Here, I used the
        same IP address and different ports.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whoa!! we did it together. Successfully created and executd the video
        chat program. You can check out the code using the below Github link.
